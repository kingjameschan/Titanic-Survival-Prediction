# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a solution to the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), focusing on predicting passenger survival using machine learning models.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
Titanic-Survival-Prediction/
â”œâ”€â”€ train.csv                 # Training dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ test.csv                  # Test dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ submission.csv            # Your prediction output (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ titanic_predict.ipynb     # Main notebook with data processing and modeling
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## ðŸš€ Features

- Missing value imputation (Age, Fare, Embarked)
- Categorical encoding (Sex, Embarked)
- Feature engineering: `FamilySize`, `HasCabin`
- Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Output submission file for Kaggle competition

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

Please place the original `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the root directory.  
Alternatively, unzip the provided [`titanic_data.zip`](./titanic_data.zip) if available.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open `titanic_predict.ipynb` and run all cells.

## ðŸ“¤ Submission

After generating predictions, export your `submission.csv` in the required Kaggle format:

```
PassengerId,Survived
892,0
893,1
...
```
